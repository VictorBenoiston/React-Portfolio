Yeah, you're right, out of the sudden I left my countryside home in Brazil, and found muyself in the middle of the Silicon Valley. Once I was there, I had the chance to realize the power of tech. I had the amazing once in a lifeitme chance to visit the Facebook (now, MetaÂ®) Headquarters. Since then, I've been studying. My first programming language was Python. I fell in love for it! The syntax is great, and easy to learn. Once I discovered the AI branch, that feeling was back. I had the chance to develop an amazing work using a KNN algorithm, to create a recommender system. Now, I am focousing on the Front-End branch. Currently working with React, JS, Redux and Tailwind.",
